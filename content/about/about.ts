*  About me
*  I started my career as a software developer in 2018,
*  shortly after graduating from SAIT. I started working
*  at a company that developed software for supply chain
*  and logistics, where I worked for nearly two years. I
*  learned a lot along the way.
*
*  I now work for a company named Launchcode that I really
*  love. I am an intermediate full-stack developer, and I
*  get to work on amazing and challenging projects.
*
*  I hope to learn as much as I can about software, as well
*  as improve my soft skills and become a better person in
*  the process.
